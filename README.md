# arma3-scenarios

Modified Arma 3 scenarios, primarily the excellent co10 escapes.

# Environment variables
Running `task local` requires a path to your multiplayer missions directory to automatically move compiled missions into. Set this in a `.env` file at the root of this repository and define a `LOCAL_OUT_PATH` variable.

Example for a WSL setup:
```bash
LOCAL_OUT_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_USER/Documents/Arma 3 - Other Profiles/YOUR_ARMA_NAME/mpmissions
```
